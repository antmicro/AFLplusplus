Full-system binary-only instrumentation in Renode for afl-fuzz
==============================================================

  (See ../README.md for the general instruction manual.)

0) TL;DR: just run anything
---------------------------

1. Download latest portable build of Renode from https://builds.renode.io/
   and unpack it to ~/renode or anywhere else.

2. Build some system to test, e.g. Zephyr shell sample for nRF52840 and
   copy it to this renode_mode directory (you will need Zephyr SDK, see
   their docs[0]):

   $ west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 samples/subsys/shell/shell_module
   $ cp build/zephyr/zephyr.elf /path/to/AFL/renode_mode

3. (If needed, edit the example.resc file; by default nRF52840 is used)
4. (If needed, edit the afl_uart.py file; serial device might be named
    differently on other boards/targets)
5. (If needed, adjust any other constants in afl_renode.py)
6. Run:

   $ cd /path/to/AFL
   $ make
   $ mkdir INPUTS
   $ echo 'abcdefxyz' > INPUTS/some-testcase  # true corpus works better
   $ PATH=$PATH:<path-to-renode> AFL_SKIP_BIN_CHECK=1 ./afl-fuzz -t 15000 -i INPUTS -o OUTPUTS -R -- renode_mode/example.resc

1) Introduction
---------------

Renode[1] is an open-source simulation framework developed by Antmicro,
allowing users to run their unmodified software on a range of embedded
targets, ranging from MCUs to multi-core Linux-capable systems, on
various architectures, like ARM Cortex-A,R,M, RISC-V, POWER and others.
Renode allows for single- and multi-node simulation via various
connectivity methods: Ethernet, BLE, IEEE802.15.4 etc.

The code in this directory is used for a standalone feature that
leverages Renode and allows callers to obtain instrumentation output for
black-box, closed-source binaries for full bare-metal systems rather
than user-mode executables.  This mechanism can be then used by afl-fuzz
to stress-test targets in a context of a full system simulation,
including the OS and HAL level, or targets that couldn't be built as
user-mode binaries.

The idea is heavily based on deferred fork server mode and QEMU mode.

2) How to use
-------------

The feature is implemented with a fairly small plugin for Renode.  As
usual with Renode, you need a Renode script and platform description.
See its documentation[2] for more details about that.  The default
harness assumes a single-node setup instrumenting code executed on
sysbus.cpu and feeding input through sysbus.uart0 char-by-char whenever
the CPU looks idle.

The example script ready for fuzzing is in the example.resc file.  It is
based on the nRF52840 platform, but can be easily adapted to other
Renode-supported targets.

If you want to change the harness, you can do so by copying the
afl_uart.py file over, changing it, and importing the new file instead
in your .resc file of choice, 'import antigravity'-style.  See the
example.resc file for how to do it.
